## Intro
ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art conversational artificial intelligence developed by OpenAI, capable of generating human-like responses to a wide range of prompts. Using the power of deep learning, natural language processing, and a massive dataset of human conversation, ChatGPT can understand the nuances of language and provide intelligent and engaging responses to users. With its ability to learn and adapt to new information, ChatGPT represents a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing.

ChatGPT has been used in a variety of applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation tools, and has quickly become a popular tool for developers and businesses looking to enhance their customer engagement and user experience.

But how about if we are able to start ChatGPT conversation with a keyboard shortcut right inside your dmenu?

## Prerequisites
- **OpenAI API key for GPT-3**

	You can obtain a key from https://openai.com/ for research and development purposes.
	
- **Dmenu**

    - [Rofi](https://davatorium.github.io/rofi/) or dmenu for linux 
    - [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) for Mac

-  **Shell GPT**

	A command-line productivity tool powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)
	Source: https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt


## Configuration
### Linux

- **Script**

    The following shell script is designed to interact with OpenAI's SGPT API and display the result in a user-friendly way using either rofi or zenity.
    Copy the script to the directory of your preference.

- **Keyboard shortcut to launch chatgpt prompt**

    Replace {PATH_TO_SGPT_SCRIPT_FILE} with actual path in your system and add it to _~/.config/openbox/rc.xml_.
    Reload the openbox configuration to changes to take effect.

    Now, you can launch chatgpt prompt by pressing <kbd>Mod</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>

    > I am using Archcraft OS with Openbox window manager. So shortcut configuration varies between different WMs and Desktop environments.
